## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Basic familiarity with terminal commands

## Purpose

Designed to accelerate your coding endeavors, the Universal Dev Environment offers an effortless and consistent platform for various projects. With automation scripts and a wide range of customization options, your development experience is taken to the next level.

## Quick Setup

1. Get started quickly by using this repository as a template to create your new Codespace:
   - Click the "Use this template" button to generate a repository based on this template.
   - Visit your new repository, and click the "Code" button, then select "Open with Codespaces."

2. Navigate to the terminal within your Codespace.

3. Initiate the setup process by copying and pasting the following command:

```bash
.devcontainer/setup.sh
```

This script will seamlessly guide you through the creation of a new user, system updates, and a series of customization options, including the generation of an SSH key for GitHub integration, installing Node Version Manager, Node.js, Pyenv, Python, and Pipx.

> Note: While using third-party scripts, exercise caution to ensure there's no malicious code.

If you intend to make this Codespace your primary development environment, respond with "yes" when prompted. This will result in the generation of an SSH keypair, with your public key displayed in the terminal, once the script completes. 

## Importing Your Public Key

1. Visit [this link](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new) to navigate to the GitHub SSH key settings.
2. Copy and paste the public key from your Codespace terminal.
3. Assign a meaningful name to this key for easy identification.
4. Click "Create SSH Key" to finalize the process.

With your public key imported, your Codespace is now seamlessly linked to your GitHub account, enabling you to clone repositories, collaborate, and code without constraints.

Your development journey starts here. Happy coding!
