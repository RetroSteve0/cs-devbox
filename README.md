If you receive anew prompt after typing the password you set for the user you just created and the `whoami` command returns your new username, you should be set. Running `sudo -l` is also a good test. If you see something similar to `(root) NOPASSWD: ALL`, you're good to go. You know the password, so now if you're prompted for a password for any commands you can now successfully authenticate.
